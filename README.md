Instructions to play the game with no difficulties:
    First of all, you need a foe to play against, enter your names, and keep in mind player1 is always X and player2 is always O.

The scoreboard will always be displayed to count each player's score.

The X-O board is designed to compensate either the value of X or O in any of the numbers displayed (1 till 9)

The game will ask player1 to make their move, he will choose where he wants to play
by entering the number that's located in the same position where:
Number 1 corresponds to Top left position.
NUmber 2 corresponds to Top middle position.
Number 3 corresponds to Top right position.
Number 4 corresponds to Middle left position.
Number 5 corresponds to Center position.
Number 6 corresponds to Middle right position.
Number 7 corresponds to Left bottom position.
Number 8 corresponds to Middle bottom position.
Number 9 corresponds to Right bottom position.

After player1 makes their move the X-O board will appear again
Then, player2 will be asked to make their move.

The game will continue by the same method alternatively until one of the players wins.

You will win if you align 3 of your symbols (X or O) under each other, beside each other
or diagonally.

When a player wins the scoreboard will appear with the new score.

You will be asked to either play again or not, if you want to play again type 'yes'
After that, you will be asked if you want to switch sides where in case of typing 'yes' the player who
played with X will play with O and vice versa, then the game will start again and so on.

When you type 'no' when asked to play again the game will display the final winner who will have a higher score.

In case of a draw the game will display the draw statement and the scores will remain the same.

What are you waiting for?! Grab a foe and beat them!
